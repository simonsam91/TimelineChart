  "description": "Timeline charts represent events in chronological order.\nThe exact timeline chart implementation steps depend on the data source. Below are general recommendations on how to create a timeline chart.\n \n\n\nChoose a series type\nEach event is represented by its name and start/end dates. In this case, the series type should have points with one argument and two values, for example, the Range Bar.\n\n\nBind the series to data\nYou can bind the series to data directly or use a series template (depending on the data source). These approaches and their differences are described in the Bind Series to Data article. In this demo, we use a series template.\n\n\nLine up bars\nSpecify the barOverlapGroup to arrange bars in a line that displays a combined timeline.\n\n\nRotate the chart\nA range bar chart's bars are vertical. To make them horizontal, set the rotated property to true.\n\n\nSort the events chronologically\nArguments maintain objects' order in the data source. If this order is not chronological, use the axis' categories array to specify the order.\n\n\n",
